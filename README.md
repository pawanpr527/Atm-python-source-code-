# 🏧 ATM Simulation in Python (OOP)

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It is intended for learning and practicing core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and method-based interactions.

## 📌 Features

- User authentication (basic PIN check or simulated login)
- Check balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Error handling (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid input)

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Instance Variables and Methods
- Encapsulation
- Input handling and control flow
